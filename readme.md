About 
============

This is a collection of java implementations of popular algorithms.


Overview
===========


The package <b> org.algorithm </b> contains java implementations of several well-known problems in CS. Here is the list of classes:

Cellular - event propagation in 2D grid

DescreteOptimisation - brute force solution for typical MinMax problem

Dijkstra - implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in graph theory

DijkstraWithDuplicates - the alternative implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, this one finds all minimal paths (i.e. duplicates if there are any)

HeapSort - implementation of Heap structure from scratches

Kadane - implementation of Kadane's algorithm for maximum sum subarray

Kadane2d - implementation of Kadane's algorithm for maximum sum of subarray in 2D array

KahanSum - implementation of Kahan's algorithm for accurate summations, very useful in high precision calculations

LCS1 - implementation for Longest Common Subsequence

MergeIntervals - merging subarrays into one array

MergeSort - implementation of Merge Sort algorithm

NQueens - shows the brute force solution for N Queens  problem

PathfinderDFS - implementation of DFS

PathfinderBFS - implementation of BFS

Permutation - implementation of recursive algorithm to find all permutaions of elements for given array

StringConversion -  dynamic programming approach to calculate differences between 2 strings

SubsetSum.java -  dynamic programming approach to find the exact subset's sum

SubstringSearch1 - implementation of KMP algorithm

SubstringSearch2 - implementation of Robin's algorithm

Top3 - shows the optimal way to perform statistical calculations on big sets of data

TopK - generalizations for previous example
